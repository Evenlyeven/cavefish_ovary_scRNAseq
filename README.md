Refer to [scRNAseq_analysis.rmd](https://github.com/Evenlyeven/cavefish_ovary_scRNAseq/blob/main/scRNAseq_analysis.rmd) or the rendered version [scRNAseq_analysis.html](https://github.com/Evenlyeven/cavefish_ovary_scRNAseq/blob/main/scRNAseq_analysis.html) for the analysis code associated with the scRNA-seq data. The corresponding raw data, including processed seurat object, has been deposited in GEO under accession number [GSE282933](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?&acc=GSE282933).

The interactive Shiny app for exploring the data can be accessed [here](https://simrcompbio.shinyapps.io/astmex_ovary_scrnaseq/).

[rbh_am_dr.csv](https://github.com/Evenlyeven/cavefish_ovary_scRNAseq/blob/main/rbh_am_dr.csv) contains the reciprocal best hits (RBHs) between cavefish and zebrafish.
